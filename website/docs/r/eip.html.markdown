Provides an Elastic IP resource.

```hcl
resource "ucloud_eip" "example" {
    bandwidth            = 2
    internet_charge_mode = "Bandwidth"
    name                 = "tf-example-eip"
    tag                  = "tf-example"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bandwidth` - (Optional) Maximum bandwidth to the elastic public network, measured in Mbps (Mega bit per second). This value must be specified to 0 Mbps if shared bandwidth, otherwise the ranges for bandwidth are: PayByTraffic from 1 to 200 Mbps, PayByBandwidth from 1 to 800 Mbps. The default value is "1".
* `eip_duration` - (Optional) The duration that you will buy the resource, the default value is "1". It is not required when "Dynamic" (pay by hour), the value is "0" when pay by month and the instance will be vaild till the last day of that month.
* `internet_charge_mode` -(Optional) Elastic IP charge mode. Possible values are: "Traffic" as pay by traffic, "Bandwidth" as pay by bandwidth, "ShareBandwidth" as pay by shared bandwidth. The default value is "Bandwidth".
* `internet_charge_type` - (Optional) Charge type. Possible values are: "Year" as pay by year, "Month" as pay by month, "Dynamic" as pay by hour (specific permission required). The default value is "Month".
* `internet_type` - (Optional) Elastic IP routes. Possible values are: "International" as internaltional IP and "Bgp" as BGP IP. The default value is "Bgp".
* `name` - (Optional) The name of the EIP, the default value is"EIP".
* `remark` - (Optional) The remarks of the EIP, the default value is "".
* `tag` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the EIP, the default value is"Default"(means no tag assigned).

* `create_time` - The time of creation for EIP, formatted by RFC3339 time string.
* `expire_time` - The expiration time for EIP, formatted by RFC3339 time string.
* `ip_set` - ip_set is a nested type. ip_set documented below.
* `resource` - resource is a nested type. resource documented below.
* `status` - EIP status. Possible values are: "used" as in use, "free" as available and "freeze" as associating.

The attribute (`ip_set`) support the following:

* `internet_type` - Elastic IP routes. Possible values are: "International" as internaltional IP and "Bgp" as BGP IP.
* `ip` - Elastic IP address

The attribute (`resource`) support the following:

* `eip_id` - The ID of EIP.
* `resource_id` - The ID of the resource with EIP attached.
* `resource_type` - The type of resource with EIP attached. Possible values are "instance" as instance, "vrouter" as visual router, "lb" as load balancer.
